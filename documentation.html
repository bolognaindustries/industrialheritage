                    <p>The Museo del Patrimonio Industriale in Bologna offers an interactive experience that enhances visitors' understanding of industrial heritage. This project provides a digital framework for exploring the museum's 15 significant artifacts, organized into chronological, geographical, and thematic paths. By integrating a metadata layer and geo-referencing, the platform connects artifacts to their historical and spatial contexts, creating an immersive exploration of industrial history. <br> <br>

                        The website is designed as an interactive tool that helps visitors plan their visit from home and enhances their experience inside the museum. The digital companion allows users to explore industrial heritage through interactive maps, timelines, and curated content that contextualizes each artifact within broader historical and cultural narratives. By leveraging geo-referenced content and structured pathways, the platform encourages deeper engagement with the collection, transforming the visit into a dynamic and personalized journey. <br><br>
                        
                        We selected the Museo del Patrimonio Industriale for this project due to its crucial role in preserving and showcasing Bologna’s industrial history. The museum highlights the city's technological advancements, economic transformations, and evolution of production techniques, making it a key institution for understanding the region’s industrial heritage. Its extensive collection provides valuable insights into machinery, labor practices, and historical innovations, making it an ideal choice for a digital humanities approach to cultural heritage.

                        <li><h3>Typography</h3>
                            <p>A contemporary sans-serif font, Cooper Hewitt, is used for readability on all pages except the thematic ones. Headings, such as those on the home page and regular pages, use a -webkit-text-stroke effect, making the text transparent with a white border. This transparent background approach not only embodies a modern aesthetic but also aligns with the use of images with transparency. <br>
                            The fonts in regular pages have relative font sizes, scaling from the largest heading—the website name on the home page at 16vw—to regular page headings at 12vw, subtitles at 9vw,  body text at 3vw, and notes at 2.2 vw. Line height is adjusted for readability, sometimes bold to improve contrast on gray.
                            </p>
                            <figure>

                            <h5>Thematic paths fonts</h5>
                                <p>For the thematic path Brick by Boring Brick, the free for personal use font BD Renaissance.ttf was chosen. Its appearance, transiting elements of medieval illuminated manuscripts and Renaissance typography, complements the decorative imagery. This choice helps immerse the reader in the aesthetic tradition of Bolognese terracotta, from the 15th century to the architectural decisions of the 19th and 20th centuries.
                                This design choice also serves as a visual break from the regular pages, emphasizing that Bologna's industrial heritage spans centuries to nowadays.
                                </p>
                                <p>The typography for the La Dolce Vita Italiana thematic path was carefully chosen to reflect the elegance, vibrancy, and cultural richness of Italy’s mid-20th-century industrial and culinary heritage. Every font and design choice was made to support the theme of blending tradition with innovation. <br>  
                                    The title "La Dolce Vita Italiana” and the carousel item titles (like "Gelato Machine") use Italianno, a cursive font inspired by Renaissance calligraphy. Its flowing, handwritten style captures the artistry of Italian craftsmanship and the romantic feel of La Dolce Vita (The Sweet Life), a cultural idea tied to Italy’s post-war era. The decorative strokes also resemble the elegant designs of food packaging from the 1950s and 1960s, reinforcing the theme’s connection to Italian identity. <br>
                                    For the body text, carousel descriptions, and metadata tables, we used Alegreya, a serif font that’s easy to read. Alegreya combines classic serif shapes with modern clarity, symbolizing the mix of traditional culinary practices and industrial innovation. Its balanced design makes it readable for all users, whether they’re beginners, casual readers, or experts. <br> 
                                    Headings in the informational tables (like "INFORMATION”) use Playfair Display, a serif font with bold, high-contrast strokes. This gives the technical details a sense of authority and precision, matching the theme of machinery while keeping the overall design cohesive.  
                                    The introduction title is set at `70px` for desktop and `30px` for mobile, making it a bold centerpiece that draws attention to the cultural story. Body text is sized at `1.25vw` for desktop and `15px` for mobile, ensuring it scales well across devices and stays easy to read. Carousel descriptions are fixed at `17px`, keeping them consistent for all users, while the content itself adapts to different expertise levels (Beginner, Casual, Expert).  
                                    </p>
                                <p>The font choices for the Silk Road thematic path are carefully selected to reflect the elegance, craftsmanship, and historical depth associated with the subject. We use Lora, a serif typeface, for the body and introduction, as its classic yet modern aesthetic evokes the refined artistry of silk production while ensuring readability. The introduction text, with its serif style, centered alignment, and generous spacing, enhances the immersive experience, mirroring the meticulous detail of woven textiles. This typographic approach harmonizes with the Silk Road’s narrative, blending tradition with contemporary digital design.</p>
                                </li>
                        <li><h3>Color Palette</h3>
                            <p> The website employs a minimalist color palette of black, white, and shades of gray, complemented by an accent color—orange—on select pages.This design decision is rooted in both aesthetic and functional considerations. <br>
                                The primary use of black and white, along with subtle shades of gray, ensures high contrast, which enhances accessibility and readability. The stark contrast between black and white is softened by the gray tones, helping to mitigate potential visual fatigue that can arise from excessive contrast.</p>

                            <br><p> The black-and-white palette carries a deeper thematic significance, echoing the visual language of industrialization as depicted in the works of artists like Charles Sheeler. Sheeler's art often portrayed industrialization as a force that stripped away vibrant colors, reducing the world to pale grays—a metaphor for environmental and cultural impact.</p>

                            <p>The UNESCO World Heritage Site Zollverein in Germany, an industrial landmark, utilizes black, white, and orange as aesthetic choices in its museum. This connection reinforces the website's thematic alignment with industrialization storytelling and its historical and cultural implications.</p>
                            <p>The introduction of orange as an accent color on specific pages (excluding thematic ones) serves multiple purposes. Orange, reminiscent of rust, evokes a sense of industrial decay and transformation. It also provides a visual break from the monochromatic scheme, adding dynamism and focus to key elements without overwhelming the overall minimalist aesthetic.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>On the other hand, the thematic pages present a completely different approach to the site, giving the impression of entering a separate website. This abrupt alternation was intended both to break the tension and density of the predominantly black pages and to offer a new perspective on industrialization: one that is colorful and vibrant, as reflected in the items presented. In these pages, there is also a duality of two tones, alternating between vivid and pastel colors.<br>
                            To establish a connection between such distinct sections, we added a color transition effect on the Home page images that redirect to the thematic pages, creating a visual link that prepares the user for the shift in atmosphere. Additionally, in the thematic pages, the theme-switching section and the footer maintain the overall style of the website, ensuring a cohesive identity and a seamless experience despite the variation in styles. This strategy not only balances the visual density of the site but also reinforces the narrative that industrialization can be interpreted in multiple ways, whether through the austerity of black and white or the vitality of color.

                            <figure >

                            <p>The color palette was thoughtfully designed for each theme, ensuring a cohesive and meaningful visual narrative. In Brick by Boring Brick, the combination of beige (#FCF5E9), brown (#531F00), and the orange tones from the images forms a trio of colors that evokes terracotta and earth, grounding the theme into a medieval and baroque aesthetic.
                            </p>
                            <p>For The Silk Road, Soft Ivory (#FAF3E0) was chosen as a background color because it represents silk's natural tones and provides a neutral, elegant backdrop. Deep Burgundy (#6D1B3F) was selected as the main theme color inspired by luxurious silk dyes, which conveys richness and history. This hue, paired with the accompanying images, creates a classic aesthetic that reflects the richness of the theme. 
                            </p>
                            <p>In The Machines World, the fuchsia pink brings the atmosphere and tones of Paris at the turn of the 19th century, evoking the World Fairs where the Belle Époque and Art Nouveau styles were prominently displayed in the aesthetics of the mechanical inventions presented, most of which were made of cast iron. 
                            </p>
                            <p>For La Dolce Vita Italiana, the warm red and creamy beige palette reflects the vibrancy of Italian life and its culinary heritage, evoking the colors of terracotta, fresh pasta, and sunlit landscapes. The use of black in the typography and structural elements adds a modern, industrial contrast, grounding the design in the theme of machinery and innovation.

                    <li><h4>Logos</h4>
                    <p>The logo was designed to visually represent the essence of the project, which explores Bologna's industrial heritage. It combines two key elements: gears and an hourglass. The gears symbolize industry, machinery, and progress, while the hourglass signifies the passage of time, reflecting the historical evolution of Bologna’s industrial activities. <br> The design follows the golden rectangle principle, ensuring a balanced and aesthetically pleasing composition. Symmetry was carefully applied to maintain harmony between the industrial and historical themes. <br> To ensure both precision and versatility, the logo was created as a vector SVG image using Inkscape, allowing it to be scaled for various applications without losing quality. The logo was exported in PNG format with transparency, enhancing its adaptability across different mediums while preserving its impact and readability. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Two versions of the logo are used:</p>

                        </figure>                        
                        <p>This approach ensures that the logo remains effective across different contrasting backgrounds.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Icons</h4>
                    <p>The icons were designed to maintain visual consistency with the path images by incorporating circular elements throughout. Each icon was created in vector SVG format  and then exported in PNG format with transparency for integration into different backgrounds. To align with the project's design language, the icons were customized for each color palette used. Additionally, to enhance user interaction and visibility, each icon has a corresponding inverted version.</p>

                        The website’s interactive elements have been designed to ensure seamless navigation and engagement. Buttons and other interactive components are styled consistently, with navigation buttons (previous, next) featuring a uniform color scheme and hover effects. To enhance usability, forms and input fields have been given clear borders and distinct focus states. <br>
                        Text display and readability have been optimized through the implementation of adaptable text choices. Users can toggle between different levels of detail to suit their background knowledge, ensuring an accessible and engaging experience. Font sizes, weights, and spacing have been carefully adjusted to maintain legibility across various screen sizes and user preferences.<br>
                        Responsive design has been implemented to accommodate different screen sizes and devices. Media queries have been used to adjust layouts dynamically, ensuring proper display on both desktop and mobile interfaces. The navigation bar and carousel adapt to different viewports, with elements adjusting in size and placement for an optimized viewing experience. Additionally, images are displayed in a way that balances performance with visual clarity, ensuring a smooth browsing experience for all users.

                    <p>Our workflow began with an initial design phase using Figma and Canva to create the first draft of the website’s structure and visual elements. This allowed us to establish a clear layout and define user interactions before moving on to the implementation phase. <br>
                        During development, these design concepts were translated into a functional website, ensuring that all features aligned with the project's goals. The evaluation phase followed, where usability, accessibility, and overall user experience were tested, and refinements were made based on feedback.<br>Contributions were made individually by each team member to different aspects of the project, from design and coding to content creation and testing, allowing for a collaborative and iterative development process.</p>

                            <p><em>Gallery & La Dolce Vita Italiana</em><br> 
                            For my bachelor’s degree, I studied Linguistic and Translation Studies, which sparked my interest in how language and culture intersect with technology. This passion led me to focus on designing and developing the La Dolce Vita Italiana thematic page, where I aimed to capture the essence of Italy’s mid-20th-century industrial and culinary heritage through deliberate typographic and visual choices. I also created the Gallery page, ensuring a cohesive and interactive presentation of the museum’s artifacts. These tasks allowed me to explore the balance between aesthetic design and functional accessibility, which I found to be the most rewarding part of the project.</p></il>

                                <p><em>Chronological path & The Silk Road</em><br>
                                    My background is in Languages and Literature and my contribution to the industrial museum website was deeply rooted in shaping its content and thematic structure to enhance the cultural and historical value of the items, making the website both an immersive and informative experience. I worked on the timeline section, organizing the artifacts in a clear chronological sequence to help users trace the evolution of industrial advancements. Additionally, I contributed to the Silk Road thematic page, a section that I found particularly captivating. Exploring the rich heritage of silk production and its impact on trade and craftsmanship allowed me to present the narrative in an engaging and meaningful way.
