                    <p>Sandstone, common in the Po Valley, is a relatively soft sedimentary rock, prone to wear over time, especially when exposed to weather elements like rain and wind. Compared to harder, more durable stones like marble or limestone, which were widely used in Italian cities such as Florence and Rome, the sandstone from the Bologna region didn’t offer the necessary durability for large constructions.</p>

                    <p>Due to this geological limitation, architects and builders in Bologna turned to bricks as the most economical viable solution. Clay was easy to mold, and once fired, resulted in durable and versatile bricks. Moreover, bricks provided good structural strength and could be used in different types of buildings, from residences to defensive towers and large public buildings.</p>

                    <p>Over time bricks also became an aesthetic and distinctive feature of the city’s architecture. This is evident in the ornamental richness of many medieval and Renaissance buildings, which used bricks not only for functionality but also to create decorative patterns that expressed Bologna’s architectural identity.</p>
