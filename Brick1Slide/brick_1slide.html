            <h1>Brick by Boring Brick</h1>
            <p>The history of brick design in Bologna dates to ancient times, with the city becoming renowned for its use of brick, particularly in the medieval and Renaissance periods. Located in the Po Valley, Bologna had abundant clay, making brick production easier, while local stone, like sandstone, was less suitable for durable construction. <br> The use of bricks was an economic necessity, not just an aesthetic choice.</p>
